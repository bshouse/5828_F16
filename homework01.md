#####Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.
Difficulties inherent or intrinsic in the nature of software - 

#####Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.
Accidents: difficulties related to the production of software - Compiler troubles, code format standards, Editor, IDE, etc


#####List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.
* Complexity - 
 * Communication problems
 * Turnover 
 * Domains are complex and cannot be abstracted away
* Conformity - 
 * Arbitrary changes to process. 
 * IT Governance Rule Changes.
* Changebility - 
 * Pressues to change is greater
* Invisibility -
 * Intangible: Just bits and electric charge
 * Too complex to diagram completely


#####Define what Brooks means by a silver bullet and reconstruct his argument as to why he believes there is no silver bullet for software engineering.
Solutions address accidental difficulties and not essential difficulties. Essential difficulties cannot be abstracted away.

#####In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.

A chemist finds a way to remove salt from water 

#####In lecture, we discussed the importance of the following concepts to software engineers: abstractions, conversations, specification, translation, and iteration. Define each of these concepts as they are related to software engineering and discuss their importance.

Abstractions - Build a model
Converstaions - Talk to the people who need the software
Specifications - A list of requirements for the software
Translations - Merging Converstaions & Specifications into what is really needed
Iteration - Grown (not build)
